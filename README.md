# Trajector
 
DEMO: [Trajector](https://berkaysenkoylu.github.io/trajector-build/)

(In progress)

- Unity3D

- Click on the ball and move your mouse to setup a direction
- Then release the mouse to push the ball
- You can only aim downwards
- You have to collide with the balls to gain height
- Keep your eyes on the nullification zone (right most on the screen). If you end up in it, GAME OVER.
- Try to collide with different colored balls sequentially (5 sequences in particular; shown in top-right of the view)
